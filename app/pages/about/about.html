      We designed Ionic to help web developers build great mobile apps and web apps in a way that felt just like building websites. That means we focus on taking the standard HTML, CSS, and JavaScript languages you’d use to build a website and help you turn them into mobile magic. These technologies have served developers well for the last twenty years, and we think that makes them a pretty great bet for the next twenty.
    </p>

      Many developers will find that their Ionic apps can be built almost entirely with a standard web browser and any old computer. And once you’re ready to grab data from a sensor or use a new device feature like TouchID, the mobile toolkit is just an install away. We think that’s pretty neat.
    </p>
    <p>
      We’re proud to say that Ionic has been used by millions of developers to build millions of apps in more countries than we will ever visit in our lifetimes. Over those two years, we’ve been listening to your feedback on how to build a better way to build better apps.

      Ionic 2 represents that collective learning about how to make the web do more on mobile. We’ve overhauled nearly every part, from the way that users navigate through your pages, how we efficiently manage UI, to how we help you wield the true powers of the underlying device.
    </p>
    <p>
      We hope you find that Ionic 2 not only makes app development easier and faster, but more fun. Because mobile technology is all about finding new ways to change the way humans interact with the world, and we can’t think of anything more fun than that.
